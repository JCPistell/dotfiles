## My dotfiles

My current dotfiles - feel free to steal bits as you wish, but buyer beware: I take no responsibility for any issues you
encounter. The setup script here is quick and dirty - intended for doing most of the setup on a new mac. If you're
either 1) me or 2) feeling very adventurous then here's how you kick off the process:

`curl -Ls https://github.com/JCPistell/dotfiles/raw/master/setup.sh | bash`

Then sit back and watch things kind of work.
